===========================================================
Help links --- Shown in the Help-section of the header-menu
===========================================================

Only superusers can add help-links. From the frontpage, choose:

1. Superuser
2. Help links (Click *Add*):
3. Add an url to a website, a title and a description.
4. Choose the roles that will see the help-link.

To edit or view all help-links, click *Change* or the *Help links* text instead
of *Add* in step ``2`` above. In the change-view, you can select a Help-link to
edit it. The right column lets you filter the table. The role-name columns in the
table contains a green ``V`` if the link is displayed in for users with that role,
and a red ``-`` if the link is not displayed for users with that role.
