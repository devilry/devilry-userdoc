Who this guide is for
#####################
A subject is, as explained in the common concepts guide, typically a course.
This means that this guide is for administrators managing a course or a period
(semester) within a course. If you have *yellow* background color in your
header, you are using the user interface for the Subjectadmin role.

A Subjectadmin manage one or more :ref:`subject`, and/or :ref:`period`. They set up
assignments, organize students into :ref:`Groups <group_candidate_student>`, and
assignment :ref:`Examiners <examiner>` to give feedback to students.
