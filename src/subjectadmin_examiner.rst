How to give feedback to students when you are Subjectadmin
##########################################################
Starting with Devilry 1.2.1 it is no longer possible to give feedback using the
Subjectadmin role. You have to make yourself examiner.


How to make yourself examiner
#############################
The easiest way of making yourself examiner is to make yourself examiner when
creating a new assignment. If you are one of many examiners, you will have to
make sure you are tagged appropriately. The Create new assignment wizard helps
you with this when you get to that step.

The other way of making yourself examiner is to do it manually after the
assignment has been created. Select an assignment, and select the
*Students*-link. The see the help-column for more help.


How to make others examiner
###########################
This is basically the same as the previous section. Just choose other users
than yourself.


What do examiners have permission to do

.. note::
    The reason why it is no longer possible to provide feedback as Subjectadmin
    is that we have need to be able to optimize the workflows for examiners and
    subject admins independently. Mixing the roles leads to confusion in all
    but the most simple cases, and it increases the development time required
    for each change to any of the user-interfaces significantly.
