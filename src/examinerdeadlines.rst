Manage deadlines --- for Examiners
=====================================


Add a deadline
---------------

When an assignment is created, an initial deadline is set. You can not change
this deadline, however you can extend the deadline by creating a new deadline.
You usually create deadlines for the following reasons:

A student gets a failing grade
-------------------------------
If you want to give the student a change to get a new attempt Devilry will ask
you (when you publish a failing feedback) if you wish to give the group a new
deadline.

    .. All or many students needs an extended deadline
    .. ===============================================
    .. 1. Choose an assignment, and click the *Manage assignment groups* button.
    .. 2. Choose the groups that needs an extended deadline. Use the checkbox at the header of the first column to select all groups. 
    .. 3. Click *Advanced* and select *Add deadline*.

Move a deadline
----------------
Currently, examiners can not move deadlines. This is coming along with an
update of the examiner UI. For now, you have to ask an administrator if
you need to move a deadline.
