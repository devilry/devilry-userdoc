Manage deadlines --- for Examiners
=====================================


Add a deadline
##############

When an assignment is created, an initial deadline is set. You can not change
this deadline, however you can extend the deadline by creating a new deadline.
You usually create deadlines for the following reasons:

A student gets a failing grade
==============================
... and you want them to make another delivery. In this case, Devilry will ask
you (when you publish a failing feedback) if you wish to give the group a new
deadline.


Move a deadline
###############
Currently, examiners can not move deadlines. This is coming along with an
update of the examiner UI. For now, you have to ask an administrator if
you need to move a deadline.
