After the assignment is choosen you are redirected to a view that list all groups
on the assignment. 

The list may be filtered to show a more fine grained selection:

Waiting for feedback
    Shows the assignment groups that have at least one valid delivery
    and are waiting for feedback to be provided by the examiner.

Waiting for deliveries
    Shows the assignment groups that have **not** provided a valid delivery yet.

Corrected
    Shows the assignment groups that are corrected. Be aware that *Corrected* will list
    both failed and passed groups as long as they are corrected.

All
    Shows every assignment group on the assignment where yourself are the assigned examiner.
    This is the default filter upon entering the view.

To start correcting you would normally filter with the *Waiting for feedback* option. The **Write feedback**
button on the group item in the list will take you directly to the latest delivery provided by the group.
see :ref:`deliveryview` for further details.

If you need access to older deliveries provided by the group you must click on the group name header in the list 
item which redirect you a detailed view for that assignment. More information on this view in :ref:`singlegroupoverview`
